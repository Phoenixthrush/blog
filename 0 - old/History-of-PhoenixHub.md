## The History behind PhoenixHub

The first thing that I wanted to create on GitHub was a site. <br/>
Just a simple site. Nothing more and nothing else...

I started watching a html tutorial on YouTube and learned the basics, quickly searched on Google “how to set the background black css” and created some links for some useful sites.

After a week, I finally uploaded my first website to GitHub and published my first PhoenixHub version on the 2020-07-04 at 16:38:35 via “GitHub Pages" <br/> <br/>
It wasn´t that bad for my first public site but yeah, look lmao...

So much time passed and I learned so many new things, It was a create time... <br/>
I edited that site almost every day and tried new features, but I never liked the result.

The last edit on my chess looking site (which btw was really random cuz I didn´t really planned to let it look like that at the beginning):

After a while I wanted something else... <br/>
Started creating a Linktree clone but it wasn´t like my own way of sharing my socials and I couldn´t customize everything on that site...

The Linktree site ended looking like that:

Months passed and so much commits on PhoenixHub but it still wasn´t how I wanted it to be.

After some time I made the decision to recreate the Linktree site but cooler and ended with that result:

Yeah looks like the original Linktree site but still, I was happy and yeah, I made my first okay looking site.

I didn´t change the format of my template and kept using it for other internal sites like an anime page. <br/> 
I mean it was looking clean and kinda cool lmao.

I kept using that style for 9 months until I started looking for a real website…
Not just a linking website I wanted a real website.
The last "linking-website" result:

You can still visit that page [here](https://phoenixhub.phoenixthrush.com)!

Searched on GitHub for someone who could code a good looking website and found someone (HTML5 UP! | (ajlkn).
That´s my first "real" website I published via GitHub pages:

I´m gonna keep using that site until I decide to change it again...

And really thanks to GitHub and GitHub Pages <3 for giving me the option of publishing my websites for free. <br/>
I really appreciate that so much!

And also thanks to ajlkn for creating that awesome website template for free! <br/>
