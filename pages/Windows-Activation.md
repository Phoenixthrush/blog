If it doesn´t work, switch to another kms online activation server!

Another one than ```kms.lotro.cc``` is ```kms.srv.crsoo.com``` <br/>
Just change ```slmgr /skms kms.lotro.cc``` to ```slmgr /skms kms.srv.crsoo.com``` and enter ```slmgr /ato``` to activate it!

### Disclaimer!

Ofc it’s illegal to activate your windows license without really buying a key from a certified windows shop! <br/>
This tutorial only contains scripts for educational purposes! <br/>
I am not liable for anything that may happen!

I only showed you that the way of online kms activation still exists and you saw how easy it was! <br/>
I don’t want you to activate your own windows license with that method! <br/>
Also if you buy a license from a certified key shop, they won´t send you an activation script or something like that, only the key and no kms activation key. <br/>
If they do it’s a scam! <br/>
Report it to microsoft!

```cmd
slmgr /dli
```

The “dli” parameter will display the current license information with the activation status. <br/>
The result will also include the type of the key (```Retail```, ```OEM```, ```MAK```, or ```KMS``` key). <br/>
If the License status says “```Licensed```”, then you don´t have a problem. <br/>
If there is anything else, your key is not valid. <br/>
Also if you see the type as ```MAK``` or ```KMS```, and you are a general consumer, you need to contact the support and get a ```Retail``` key.
