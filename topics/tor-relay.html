                            	<h2>why everyone should host a tor relay</h2>
                            	
                            	<h3>- what even is tor?</h3>
                            	<blockquote><p>"Tor—short for "The Onion Routing" project—is an open source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The network of computers worldwide in the Tor network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users' online privacy is protected. Tor users' digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.
								</p>

								<p>The Tor technology was initially developed and solely used by the U.S. Navy, to protect sensitive government communications. The network was later made available to the public as an open-source platform, meaning that Tor's source code is accessible to everyone. Tor is upgraded and enhanced by volunteer developers in the Tor network."<br><br>By Jake Frankenfield</blockquote></p>

                            	<br>

                            	<h3>- is tor only for bad people?</h3>
                            	<blockquote><p>"Tor is designed to defend human rights and privacy by preventing anyone from censoring things, even us. We hate that there are some people who use Tor to do terrible things, but we can't do anything to get rid of them without also undermining the human rights activists, journalists, abuse survivors, and other people who use Tor for good things. If we wanted to block certain people from using Tor, we'd basically be adding a backdoor to the software, which would open up our vulnerable users to attacks from bad regimes and other adversaries."<br><br>By Tor Project</p></blockquote>


                            	<br>

                            	<h3>- so what is a tor relay you may ask?</h3>
                            	<blockquote><p>"Tor relays are also referred to as "routers" or "nodes." They receive traffic on the Tor network and pass it along. Check out the Tor website for a more detailed explanation of how Tor works.</p><p><p>There are three kinds of relays that you can run in order to help the Tor network: middle relays, exit relays, and bridges.</p>For greater security, all Tor traffic passes through at least three relays before it reaches its destination. The first two relays are middle relays which receive traffic and pass it along to another relay. Middle relays add to the speed and robustness of the Tor network without making the owner of the relay look like the source of the traffic. Middle relays advertise their presence to the rest of the Tor network, so that any Tor user can connect to them. Even if a malicious user employs the Tor network to do something illegal, the IP address of a middle relay will not show up as the source of the traffic. That means a middle relay is generally safe to run in your home, in conjunction with other services, or on a computer with your personal files. See our legal FAQ on Tor for more info.
                            	</p><p>An exit relay is the final relay that Tor traffic passes through before it reaches its destination. Exit relays advertise their presence to the entire Tor network, so they can be used by any Tor users. Because Tor traffic exits through these relays, the IP address of the exit relay is interpreted as the source of the traffic. If a malicious user employs the Tor network to do something that might be objectionable or illegal, the exit relay may take the blame. People who run exit relays should be prepared to deal with complaints, copyright takedown notices, and the possibility that their servers may attract the attention of law enforcement agencies. If you aren't prepared to deal with potential issues like this, you might want to run a middle relay instead. We recommend that an exit relay should be operated on a dedicated machine in a hosting facility that is aware that the server is running an exit node. The Tor Project blog has these excellent tips for running an exit relay. See our legal FAQ on Tor for more info.</p><p>Bridges are Tor relays which are not publicly listed as part of the Tor network. Bridges are essential censorship-circumvention tools in countries that regularly block the IP addresses of all publicly listed Tor relays, such as China. A bridge is generally safe to run in your home, in conjunction with other services, or on a computer with your personal files."<br><br>By EFF</p></blockquote>

                            	<h3>- So, how could you help the tor community?</h3>
                            	<p>You could host your own relay. This would allow you to distribute the total consumption and reduce the load on the network. A good aftereffect would be that the increased number of gate nodes would also increase the privacy sphere at the same time.</p>

                            	<h2>Setup</h2>
                                <h3>- installing tor:</h3>
                                <p>First install the "tor" package with your package manager, below are examples for debian and arch based distribution! 
                                <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fphoenixthrush-websites%2Fblog%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fembed%2Ftor-relay%2Ftor-install.sh&style=vs2015&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on"></script>

                                <br>

                                <h3>- modifying the torrc config file (/etc/tor/torrc):</h3>
                                <p>After the installation, use your favorite code editor to edit the torrc config file!<br>Here is a simple version of it:</p>
                                <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fphoenixthrush-websites%2Fblog%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fembed%2Ftor-relay%2Ftorrc-config&style=vs2015&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on"></script>

								<br>

                                <h3>- restarting the tor service:</h3>
                                <p>If the second command outputs a "active (running)" or the like in green, everything should be fine. ^^</p>

								<br>

								<h3>- [optional] enabling automatic updates:</h3>
								<p>(on debian and arch based distros)</p>
